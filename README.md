# Build a Weather Journal App

This project is focused on setting up a simple Node and Express environment to create a client-side and server-side interaction that gets current weather data from the Open Weather Map api based on user inputs and updates the client UI with the current date, current temp, and how the user is feeling.

## Project dependencies

The project dependencies include the 'cors' and 'body-parser' packages.

## Objectives

+ Obtain developer API credentials from the OpenWeatherMap.org api
+ Set up an object on the server-side to act as the API endpoint
+ API key is set up as a variable and passed to the fetch() method which successfully returns data
+ Asynchronous code should be used along with GET and POST methods
+ Promise chaining should be used

## Success Criteria

+ Naming HTML inputs and buttons for interaction
+ Assigning element properties dynamically
+ Using event listeners
+ Dynamically update the UI
+ Be responsive across devices
